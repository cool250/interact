Next let’s turn to WF Assistant.

WF Assistant is a voice enabled bot powered by AI and allows users to interact in a natural and seamless way. It has a great visual interface as well and can provide personalized and contextualized information for our customers.
 
To understand the need for AI assistant, let’s step back a bit. 

We have seen a big shift in computing every 10 years or so.
 
1.	It all started in the mid 80’s when personal computing reached the mainstream and revolutionized the way people work.
2.	Roughly a decade later. In the mid 90’s the web arrived and fundamentally change how people interact and connect with each other.
3.	About 10 years later in the mid 2000’s with the advent of smartphones we had the mobile revolution. That brought computing to more than half of the world’s population and fundamentally changed people’s life.
 
But nothing is constant and the shift continues. In words of Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, if we see where computing is headed it is clear we’re heading from a mobile first to an AI first world.
 
What do I mean by AI first world? In this world computing will be universally available in the context of user’s daily life. People will be able to interact with it naturally and seamlessly than ever before. And above it will be intelligent and will help user’s in more meaningful ways.
 
I believe the AI powered Wells Fargo assistant can be at the heart of this effort to meet our customer needs.

The WF assistant is not for any specific application or product.  It will use API’s to connect to multiple backend and use a designer tool to create new experiences that can be authored by business users to create experiences without needing any application code changes.
 
Now, we are going to demonstrate how the Virtual Assistant will work using 2 personas.
 
First one is Brad, who is not good at managing expenses, has credit card debt and needs help with reaching his savings goal.

He has recently moved into an apartment with his friends and now pays for almost all her bills himself.
 
The second persona is Angelina. Angelina is a bit further in her financial journey. She has consistently saved for years. She has a good credit score and need help in buying a house.

Let’s run though the experience for Brad.

MOVING OUT

1.	When I launch the app initially, the assistant is able to look at my past savings and recommend setting up a goal.
2.	I decide to setup a goal and click “Yes”.
3.	The assistant asks me for what would I like to setup a savings goal. The assistant knows I don’t have existing rental/mortgage or car expenses and suggests me personalized choices.
4.	Since I am deciding to move out soon, I select the “Moving Out” Goal. Here I can choose the Quick options button or use the microphone to say.
5.	The assistant asks me my probable monthly rent. Once I provide the same it will use machine learning to figure out my total expenses based on my past transactions and other similar users.
6.	I’ll say one thousand dollars here.
7.	The assistant is able to quickly calculate my total costs and shows me the breakup when I click on the widget.
8.	I’ll start this goal now


CREDIT CARD OFFER
1.	As the app see more of my transactions and usage data it knows more about me. It knows that I have a monthly credit card bill which I pay from my checking’s account. Since WF is running a credit campaign targeted for user’s like me, I get a push notification.
2.	This is all managed by a backend studio where business owners can create such experiences dynamically without any IT involvement.
3.	After it prompts me a few dialogs, I select yes. It shows me a nice UI card with all the offer details. And again, this content is all created using the Studio UI, so no developers are needed.

Let me walk you through few other interactions before I quickly show you the demo of the studio designer.


DUPLICATE SUBSCRIPTIONS
1.	The Assistant figures out expenses which might be redundant on basis of category and can prompt me to review and make changes if necessary.
2.	It makes it easy for me to cancel the subscriptions. We’ll integrate with control tower to manage removing the subscriptions.

SHOW THE VIDEO
Let’s take quick peek at the Studio environment, which allows us to build these experiences dynamically.

ANGELINA FLOW
If we have time, I would like to show you one last example for a different persona Angelina who is interested in buying a house and want to do pre-approval. We’ll show you how easy and convenient it is to apply using a virtual assistant interface.

The assistant allows me to set aside money for mortgage goal and alerts me when I am ready to apply for mortgage pre-approval.

I launch the app once I get the notification. It will walk me through the entire pre-approval process without having to fill any cumbersome forms. Since we have most of the information, we don’t have to prompt the users for everything.

Over here the assistant is able to find my savings based on my past transactions. It knows the typical monthly mortgage costs for that type of house in San Francisco and is able to use deep learning based RNN network for underwriting.
